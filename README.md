    ABSTRACT

This project presents the design and implementation of a Smart Traffic Management System using IoT technologies to enhance the efficiency and automation of urban traffic control. Leveraging components such as the ESP32 microcontroller, RFID modules, ultrasonic sensors, and vibration detectors, the system dynamically manages traffic lights based on real-time vehicle density and emergency vehicle detection.
The RFID module identifies authorized vehicles, granting them priority passage, while ultrasonic sensors monitor traffic buildup to adjust signal timing. In the event of accidents, vibration sensors trigger alerts for immediate response.
The control logic is programmed using C++ and deployed via the Arduino IDE, enabling modular and responsive traffic light control. The system successfully demonstrates real-time traffic sensing, priority-based signaling, and accident detection. This scalable solution holds significant potential for smart city applications, offering future enhancements such as cloud integration, mobile app support, and license plate recognition.
