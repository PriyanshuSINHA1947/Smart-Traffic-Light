## üìñ Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of a Smart Traffic Management System using IoT technologies. By leveraging ESP32, RFID modules, ultrasonic sensors, and vibration detectors, the system intelligently manages traffic lights based on:

- üöò Vehicle density detection
- üöë Emergency vehicle prioritization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Accident detection
  
The system is programmed in C++ using Arduino IDE and demonstrates a scalable, real-time traffic solution that can evolve into a Smart City application with cloud integration, AI prediction, and mobile app support.

## Introduction

The rapid urbanization and increasing number of vehicles have led to severe traffic congestion and delays in many cities.   
Traditional traffic systems are often static and cannot adapt to real-time traffic conditions. This project aims to design and implement a Smart Traffic Management System using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enhance traffic efficiency and safety through automation and intelligent decision-making.

## üõ† Methodology

The Smart Traffic System project follows a structured approach integrating hardware, software, and IoT-based logic to dynamically manage traffic flow. The methodology can be broken down into the following phases:

**1. Problem Identification**   

Urban traffic congestion and emergency vehicle delays are growing concerns. The project identifies the need for an adaptive, real-time traffic control system capable of addressing these issues using smart sensing and control.   

**2. System Design**

‚Ä¢	A block diagram and logical flow were conceptualized to guide system behavior.  
‚Ä¢	Design decisions were made to prioritize modularity and scalability.   

**3. Component Selection**

‚Ä¢	ESP32 was chosen as the central controller due to its processing power and built-in Wi-Fi.   
‚Ä¢	RFID module (MFRC522) enables recognition of emergency or authorized vehicles.   
‚Ä¢	Ultrasonic sensors assess vehicle density to adapt traffic signal timing.  
‚Ä¢	Relay modules and LEDs simulate traffic light behavior.   
‚Ä¢	9V battery provides portable power, enabling off-grid operation and demonstrations.  

**4. Sensor Integration and Programming**

‚Ä¢	Sensors and modules were interfaced with ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.  
‚Ä¢	Code written in C++ handles:  
  -	Real-time sensor polling.  
  -	Signal prioritization.  
  - Dynamic LED control.
   
‚Ä¢	The logic was structured to process inputs continuously and trigger appropriate outputs without manual intervention.  

**5. System Testing**

‚Ä¢	The prototype was tested under various simulated traffic conditions.    
‚Ä¢	Emergency vehicle scenarios were validated using RFID tags.
